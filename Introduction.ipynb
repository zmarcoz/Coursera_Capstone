    "Situated on one of the world's largest natural harbors, New York City is composed of five boroughs, each of which is a county of the State of New York.[15] The five boroughs—Brooklyn, Queens, Manhattan, the Bronx, and Staten Island—were consolidated into a single city in 1898.[16] The city and its metropolitan area constitute the premier gateway for legal immigration to the United States. As many as 800 languages are spoken in New York,[17] making it the most linguistically diverse city in the world.

    "New York City traces its origins to a trading post founded by colonists from the Dutch Republic in 1624 on Lower Manhattan; the post was named New Amsterdam in 1626.[21] The city and its surroundings came under English control in 1664[21] and were renamed New York after King Charles II of England granted the lands to his brother, the Duke of York.[22] New York was the capital of the United States from 1785 until 1790,[23] and has been the largest U.S. city since 1790.[24] The Statue of Liberty greeted millions of immigrants as they came to the U.S. by ship in the late 19th and early 20th centuries[25] and is a symbol of the U.S. and its ideals of liberty and peace.[26] In the 21st century, New York has emerged as a global node of creativity and entrepreneurship[27] and environmental sustainability,[28][29] and as a symbol of freedom and cultural diversity.[30] In 2019, New York was voted the greatest city in the world per a survey of over 30,000 people from 48 cities worldwide, citing its cultural diversity.[31]\n",

    "Toronto is the provincial capital of Ontario and the most populous city in Canada, with a population of 2,731,571 as of 2016.[14] Current to 2016, the Toronto census metropolitan area (CMA), of which the majority is within the Greater Toronto Area (GTA), held a population of 5,928,040, making it Canada's most populous CMA.

    "\n",
    "People have travelled through and inhabited the Toronto area, located on a broad sloping plateau interspersed with rivers, deep ravines, and urban forest, for more than 10,000 years.[19] After the broadly disputed Toronto Purchase, when the Mississauga surrendered the area to the British Crown,[20] the British established the town of York in 1793 and later designated it as the capital of Upper Canada.[21] During the War of 1812, the town was the site of the Battle of York and suffered heavy damage by American troops.[22] York was renamed and incorporated in 1834 as the city of Toronto. It was designated as the capital of the province of Ontario in 1867 during Canadian Confederation.[23] The city proper has since expanded past its original borders through both annexation and amalgamation to its current area of 630.2 km2 (243.3 sq mi).\n",
    "\n",
    "The diverse population of Toronto reflects its current and historical role as an important destination for immigrants to Canada.[24][25] More than 50 percent of residents belong to a visible minority population group,[26] and over 200 distinct ethnic origins are represented among its inhabitants.[27] While the majority of Torontonians speak English as their primary language, over 160 languages are spoken in the city.[28]\n",
